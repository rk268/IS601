<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> What can you tell me about docker? Describe the various steps needed to get an app ran inside a docker container in your own words</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Docker are likely virtual environments. They have containers in them. These containers are<br>lightweight and efficient and they can run in isolated environments. Dockers provide a<br>easy and suitable way to pack and transfer or send these containers anywhere.<div>Basically,<br>if I have a setup at my end and my friend wants to<br>run some code with my setup. He can use my container in his<br>system and run the code over that like a virtual environment. This is<br>small application of a docker.</div><div>I added the the docker file, in the flask_sample,<br>with name Dockerfile.</div><div>This docker file checks the python requirements. Also it makes the<br>containers.</div><br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> What is Heroku? Why do you feel it was chosen for this class?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Heroku is a cloud on which the user can easily deploy their workflow.<br>Heroku is flexible and easy to use as the user need not to<br>worry regarding the below infrastructure. Also it is easy to integrate with the<br>github.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> What is flask? List a few things you learned about it</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Flask is a python module and web framework on it. There is lot<br>of documentation available on it. It has minimal overhead hence good for developers.<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 4: </em> What is the difference between a Dockerfile and a Github Action .yml file?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>Dockerfile is a text file, which is used by Docker to build an<br>image which inturn used for docker container.&nbsp;<span style="letter-spacing: 0.09996px;">Github Action .yml&nbsp;&nbsp;is used to<br>write a workflow for automation of work. It is used for running tests<br>and applications in various environments. It has several steps written in sequence which<br>get executed in order.</span><div><span style="letter-spacing: 0.09996px;">Basically both files are used for a different<br>things but used in pairs as both if used together can help programmers<br>to deploy their web code easily.</span></div><br></p><br></td></tr>
